                  4 ½ contains 6 tracks with a total running time of 37 
                  minutes; brief for a Wilson affair, but a powerful 37 
                  minutes it is.As stated on his website, “4 of the 
                  songs originated during the sessions for Hand. Cannot. 
                  Erase., and one from the recording sessions for the 
                  previous album The Raven that Refused to Sing.  
                  The final track is a version of Don’t Hate Me, 
                  a song originally recorded by Porcupine Tree in 1998, 
                  and is based on a live recording made on the recent 
                  tour of Europe with additional recording later done in 
                  the studio.

                This cheeky label stems from how Wilson’s complex, melancholic brand of progressive rock earns him praise from critics and loyal fans, but not a household name. Still, his recent music has been his most popular to date. With this gradual growth in popularity, To the Bone comes to glorious fruition as a surprisingly optimistic and accessible record. This transformation feels appropriate, especially with the modern musical influences on predecessors Hand. Cannot. Erase. and mini-album 4 ½. To the Bone is a bold new direction for Wilson: a lush, diverse rock odyssey overflowing with creativity.

                   The basic story, or concept of the record – it's about a woman growing up, who goes to live in the city, very isolated, and she disappears one day and no one notices. There's more to it than that. Now, what's really interesting about this story is that your initial reaction when you hear a story like that is, 'Ah, little old bag lady that no one notices, no one cares about.' [Vincent] wasn't [like that]. She was young, she was popular, she was attractive, she had many friends, she had family, but for whatever reason, nobody missed her for three years.

                      Based on a series of self-penned ghost stories in the tradition of Edgar Allen Poe and Arthur Machen, The Raven That Refused to Sing explodes into life with a stripped-down art-rock thud before morphing seamlessly into all manner of wildly evocative soundscapes, melodic crescendos and mellotron-drenched fever dreams. Honed to peak fitness by recent touring, Wilson's band whip up an electrifying storm of amorphous vitality, their grasp of light and shade ensuring that something as elaborate and adventurous as The Watchmaker never loses focus or fire.

                      A collaboration between Israeli singer songwriter Aviv Geffen and British musician and producer Steven Wilson. Two yearsback and forth on the London-Tel-Aviv flight path, a mutual artistic curiosity and a close friendship are the components thatgave birth to Aviv and Steven's Blackfield project. Aviv Geffen, a highly successful solo artist and outspoken (not to mention controversial) peace campaigner, with a string ofgold albums in his own country, discovered the music of Steven's band Porcupine Tree in the mid 90's and followed theircareer development.

                    Grace for Drowning has a particular conception in terms of its emotional journey from sadness through anger to acceptance, but it is also just another in a lengthy discography of albums by Wilson under various names in relatively similar styles

                    Insurgentes pulls together all of the various sonics that Wilson explores in all of his projects, with a special emphasis on noise and drone, genres that he usually performs as Bass Communion. Had he tried to record this under any other of his band’s monikers, it wouldn’t have made sense. Songs on the album are somewhat linear, with memorable choruses and riffs aplenty, though usually songs build up to harsh quells of noise and static
